Operating system updates
========================

NethServer 8 is installed on top of Linux distributions and strives to
preserve default configurations as much as possible. The system
administrator has the flexibility to choose how operating system updates
are applied.

It is generally advisable to apply operating system updates promptly. If
you have an active subscription, updates are automatically applied as
described in the :ref:`scheduled-updates` section. Otherwise, consult your
distribution documentation for guidance:

* `Rocky Linux/AlmaLinux <https://docs.rockylinux.org/guides/security/dnf_automatic/>`_
* `Debian <https://wiki.debian.org/UnattendedUpgrades>`_

CentOS Stream is regarded as a preview of the next stable RHEL release.
Updates may introduce new software versions that could potentially cause
unexpected issues. To enable automatic updates on CentOS Stream, simply
follow the same instructions as outlined for Rocky Linux.

For updates to core and modules, refer to :ref:`updates-section`.
