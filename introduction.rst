About NethServer 8
==================

NethServer 8 (NS8) is an application server specifically designed for
small offices and medium enterprises. It facilitates the management of
applications through a user-friendly web interface. NS8 operates as a
container orchestrator, a system that can manage and coordinate the
deployment of various applications.

One of its key features is the ability to host different applications on a
single machine or distribute the workload across multiple nodes. This
flexibility allows for efficient resource utilization and scalability
based on the organization's needs.

NS8 represents the evolution of NethServer 7, which was a complete Linux
distribution based on CentOS. However, NS8 departs from this model and can
now be installed over different Linux distributions, providing users with
more choices and compatibility options.
