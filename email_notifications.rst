Email notifications
===================

Many applications require access to an SMTP server to send mail.

You can configure the same SMTP server for all installed applications by
accessing the ``Email notifications`` card inside the ``Settings`` page.

Then, enable the feature by clicking on ``Send notifications with an SMTP
server`` and fill the required details.
